A few years ago, Louisville Metro government set out to increase transparency through &#8216;open data.&#8217; What does this mean? Well, the short answer is that it means they released a crazy amount of data covering several government departments. However, it also means that they are providing data to nerdy people to do nerdy things with â€“ hence, QuantifyLouisville.

The goal of this site is to analyze the hell out of this data, and tease out the stories within. Using blood, sweat, and mathematics we hope to provide some value through this process. But, if that doesn&#8217;t happen, we hope to at least tell some interesting stories!
